While me and Yuda did the bulk of the code and artwork, we did use a lot of work from other people. Here are the resources that we used:

Sounds acquired from the following users on freesound.org:

Vampirella17
SynaMax
Inferno

Map tiles acquired from Elona (http://homepage3.nifty.com/rfish/index_e.html)

In addition, some code snippets were taken (placed in tools.py):
